          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>As the previous answer suggested, "Yes I have. Well, I like to think so ...", but in theory, not really. Some time ago I was playing "Hattrick", which is a browser-based massively multiplayer online football management game. Aim is to create a football team and compete against other users, and one of the options was to create your own club website where you would provide news and results. The website was my first touch with programming and web design. </div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>I believe that my artistic skills and vision would not help me becoming a designer. </div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>This course was always my first preference. I have done some IT studies before, and now it is a time to finish what I started long time ago. </div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>Knowledge and experience :) </div>

          <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</div>
          <div>Not really a crucial strength, but I am almost always available. I always put extra effort when working in groups, as there's always that feel that I might be responsible for not getting higher mark. I like attention to detail and would love the "partner in crime" to have the same. </div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>I am big sports fan, sports websities would be most popular on my list. </div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>I love animals, and I am the owner of German Shepherd dog and love to cook, which reflects on my body shape, but saying that you won't see me at My Kitchen Rules or MasterChef</div>
